Batstone RT, O’Brien AM, Harrison TL, Frederickson ME. Experimental
evolution makes microbes more cooperative with their local host
genotype.

### Abstract

Advances in microbiome science require a better understanding of how
beneficial microbes adapt to hosts. We tested if hosts select for more
cooperative microbial strains with a year-long evolution experiment and
a cross-inoculation experiment designed to explore how nitrogen-fixing
bacteria (rhizobia) adapt to legumes. We paired *Ensifer meliloti* with
one of five *Medicago truncatula* genotypes that vary in how strongly
they ‘choose’ bacterial symbionts. Independent of host choice, *Ensifer
meliloti* rapidly adapted to its local host genotype and derived
microbes were more beneficial when they shared evolutionary history with
their host. This local adaptation was mostly limited to the symbiosis
plasmids, with mutations in putative signalling genes. Thus, cooperation
depends on the match between partner genotypes and increases as bacteria
adapt to their local host.

### Contents

This repository contains the raw data and analyses for:

#### Evolution experiment

This folder contains the raw data from the evolution experiment, the
linear model results presented in the main text of the paper, and the
code that generated Figure 1 in the main text and supplemental figure
S6.

#### Single-inoculation experiment

This folder contains the raw data from the single-inoculation
experiment, the model results presented in Tables S1 and S2, and the
code that generated Figure 2 in the main text, as well as supplemental
figures S1 through S4.

#### Variant discovery

This folder contains the code and data to call and filter variants in
the whole genome sequences of our ancestral and derived *Ensifer
meliloti* strains. It also contains the code that generated supplemental
figure S5.

#### GWAS
